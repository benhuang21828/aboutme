# aboutme

This is a Django REST project to create a JSON end point with my experiences and bio, so I can play around with multiple templates without retyping the same information. 

project ==> aboutme/resume/api/

Functionalities:
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - PATCH
  - DELETE
  - **User Auth**

My personal end points can be found at 
Experience ==> <a href="http://ec2-52-10-163-61.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/resume/experience/"> Click here for Exp</a>
Bio ==> <a href="http://ec2-52-10-163-61.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/resume/bio/">Click here for Bio</a>

I've made an front-end app to pull data from these end-points. Its my github.io page <a href="benhuang21828.github.io"> Here </a>
